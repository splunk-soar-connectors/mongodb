This app will ignore the HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY environment variables, as it does not use HTTP to connect to the database.

<h3>On Creating New Databases and Collections</h3>
<p>
When creating a new asset, you must specify something for the <b>database</b> parameter, which will be the name of the database.
If you specify one which does not currently exist, then the app will carry on as normal (though there will be a warning in the
test connectivity modal). After running a <b>post data</b> action, then that database will be created. Similarly, by specifying
a <b>collection</b> which does not currently exist as a parameter to <b>post data</b>, you can create new collections.
</p><br>

<h3>BSON Strings</h3>
<p>
Many parameters in this app, like <b>data</b> and <b>filter</b> expect a deserializable BSON string.
In respects to this app, BSON is a superset of JSON, so any valid JSON will be properly deserialized.
However, BSON can also deserialize many other types. For example, MongoDB uses an ObjectID type by default for the "_id" field.
In order to use this, like to create a filter, the BSON string will look like <code>{"_id": {"$oid":"5a345190f059c57581d754f0"}}</code>.
If you can install the appropriate python modules (i.e. pymongo) then you can serialize python dictionaries to the appropriate string
in your playbook code.  If that approach isn't possible, the result data from <b>get data</b> will contain the appropriate
representations, as well, which can be used as reference for future actions.
